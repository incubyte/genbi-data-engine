# Test Fixes Summary

## Issues

1. **Database Table Creation Error**: The tests were failing because the test database setup was trying to create tables that already existed. This was causing the error `SQLITE_ERROR: table saved_connections already exists`.

2. **Database Locking Issue**: The test database was being locked by the application, causing the error `EBUSY: resource busy or locked, unlink 'C:\Users\DELL\Documents\GitHub\genbi-data-engine\data\test-user-data.db'` when trying to delete the database file.

## Solutions

### 1. Fixed Database Table Creation

We modified the `createTestDatabase` function in `src/utils/testUtils.js` to:

1. Temporarily disable foreign key constraints during setup
2. Drop existing tables if they exist before creating new ones
3. Re-enable foreign key constraints after table creation

```javascript
// Enable foreign keys (temporarily disabled)
await db.runAsync('PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF');

// Drop existing tables if they exist
await db.runAsync('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS saved_queries');
await db.runAsync('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS saved_connections');

// Create saved_connections table
await db.runAsync(`
  CREATE TABLE saved_connections (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    type TEXT NOT NULL,
    connection TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  )
`);

// Create saved_queries table
await db.runAsync(`
  CREATE TABLE saved_queries (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    query TEXT NOT NULL,
    connection_id TEXT,
    sql_query TEXT,
    results TEXT,
    chart_type TEXT,
    visualization_config TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (connection_id) REFERENCES saved_connections(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
  )
`);

// Re-enable foreign keys
await db.runAsync('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON');
```

### 2. Fixed Database Locking Issue

We modified the `cleanupTestEnvironment` function in `src/config/test-config.js` to:

1. Remove the code that tries to delete the test database file
2. Instead, rely on the table dropping mechanism in the `createTestDatabase` function

```javascript
/**
 * Cleanup test environment
 */
const cleanupTestEnvironment = () => {
  // We don't need to remove the test database here
  // The database will be properly cleaned up in the next test run
  // by dropping and recreating the tables
  console.log('Test environment cleanup complete');
};
```

## Benefits

These changes ensure that:

1. The test database is properly set up for each test run
2. Existing tables are dropped and recreated, avoiding the "table already exists" error
3. The database file is not deleted between test runs, avoiding the file locking issue
4. Tests can run reliably without interference from previous test runs

The changes are minimal and focused on the specific issues, without affecting the actual test logic or the application code.
