# MySQL Schema Extraction Fix

## Issues
1. The MySQL schema extraction was failing when connecting to a MySQL database, particularly when running in a Docker container. The issue was that the schema extraction process would fail completely if any part of the extraction (like getting foreign keys or indexes) encountered an error.

2. The column names in the MySQL information_schema tables were not being properly accessed. MySQL uses uppercase column names in its information_schema tables (e.g., TABLE_NAME instead of table_name), but our queries were using lowercase column names.

## Solutions

### 1. Improved Error Handling
We made the following improvements to the `extractSchema` method in the `mysqlService.js` file:

- **Added more detailed logging**:
  - Added logging for the current database name
  - Added logging for each table being processed
  - Added logging for the number of columns, foreign keys, and indexes found

- **Added error handling for individual tables**:
  - Wrapped the processing of each table in a try-catch block
  - If an error occurs while processing a table, we log the error and continue with the next table
  - The table with the error gets an empty schema (empty columns, foreign keys, and indexes)

- **Added error handling for foreign keys and indexes**:
  - Wrapped the foreign key and index extraction in separate try-catch blocks
  - If an error occurs while getting foreign keys or indexes, we log a warning and continue with empty arrays

- **Improved overall error handling**:
  - Instead of throwing an error if the schema extraction fails, we now return an empty schema
  - This ensures that the application can continue to function even if the schema extraction fails

### 2. Fixed Column Name Case Sensitivity
We updated all the SQL queries to use the correct uppercase column names from the MySQL information_schema tables and explicitly aliased them to lowercase for our code:

- **Tables Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT TABLE_NAME as table_name
  FROM information_schema.tables
  WHERE table_schema = ?
  AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
  ```

- **Columns Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT
    COLUMN_NAME as column_name,
    DATA_TYPE as data_type,
    IS_NULLABLE as is_nullable,
    COLUMN_DEFAULT as column_default,
    COLUMN_KEY as column_key
  FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_schema = ?
  AND table_name = ?
  ORDER BY ordinal_position
  ```

- **Foreign Keys Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT
    k.CONSTRAINT_NAME as constraint_name,
    COLUMN_NAME as column_name,
    k.REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME as referenced_table_name,
    REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME as referenced_column_name,
    UPDATE_RULE as update_rule,
    DELETE_RULE as delete_rule
  FROM information_schema.key_column_usage k
  JOIN information_schema.referential_constraints r
    ON k.CONSTRAINT_NAME = r.CONSTRAINT_NAME
    AND k.CONSTRAINT_SCHEMA = r.CONSTRAINT_SCHEMA
  WHERE k.TABLE_SCHEMA = ?
    AND k.TABLE_NAME = ?
    AND k.REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME IS NOT NULL
  ```

- **Indexes Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT
    INDEX_NAME as index_name,
    NON_UNIQUE as non_unique
  FROM information_schema.statistics
  WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = ?
    AND TABLE_NAME = ?
  GROUP BY INDEX_NAME, NON_UNIQUE
  ```

## Benefits
These changes make the MySQL schema extraction more robust and resilient to errors. Even if parts of the schema extraction fail, the application will still be able to extract as much schema information as possible and continue functioning. Additionally, the fixes for column name case sensitivity ensure that the schema extraction works correctly with MySQL databases.

## Testing
To test these changes, you can:

1. Connect to a MySQL database with tables that have foreign keys and indexes
2. Connect to a MySQL database with tables that don't have foreign keys or indexes
3. Connect to a MySQL database with restricted permissions

In all cases, the schema extraction should now complete without throwing errors, and it should extract as much schema information as possible based on the available permissions and database structure.
