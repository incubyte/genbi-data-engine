# Schema Optimization for Large Databases

## Overview

The Schema Optimization feature addresses a critical limitation when working with large database schemas: prompt size constraints in LLM APIs. When database schemas contain dozens or hundreds of tables, sending the entire schema to the LLM can:

1. Exceed token limits
2. Dilute the model's focus
3. Result in lower quality SQL generation
4. Increase response times
5. Raise API costs due to high token usage

Our solution intelligently extracts only the most relevant portions of the schema based on the user's natural language query.

## How It Works

The process follows these steps:

1. **Query Analysis**: Parse the user query and extract key terms
2. **Table Scoring**: Score each table based on its relevance to the query:
   - Direct name matches (table or column names appear in the query)
   - Semantic relevance (table purpose relates to query intent)
   - Common data elements (dates, prices, quantities, etc. mentioned in query)
3. **Relationship Preservation**: Include tables connected through foreign keys
4. **Schema Reduction**: Select only the highest-scoring tables up to the configured limit
5. **Optimized Prompt**: Generate the prompt with this reduced schema

## Implementation

The feature is implemented in the `schemaExtractor.js` file, which provides the `extractRelevantSchema` method:

```javascript
// Extract relevant schema portions based on user query
extractRelevantSchema(schema, userQuery, options = {})
```

### Key Configuration Options

- `maxTables`: Maximum number of tables to include (default: 20)
- `includeForeignKeys`: Whether to include related tables through foreign keys (default: true)

## Usage

The schema optimizer is integrated into the `generateSqlQuery` method in the `anthropicService.js` file and is enabled by default for schemas with more than 10 tables:

```javascript
// In anthropicService.js
async generateSqlQuery(userQuery, schema, dbType, options = {}) {
  // Extract relevant schema if optimization is enabled
  const optimizeSchema = options.optimizeSchema !== false;
  const schemaSize = Object.keys(schema).length;
  let optimizedSchema = schema;
  
  if (optimizeSchema && schemaSize > 10) {
    optimizedSchema = schemaExtractor.extractRelevantSchema(schema, userQuery, {
      maxTables: options.maxTables || 20,
      includeForeignKeys: true
    });
  }
  
  // Build prompt with optimized schema
  // ...
}
```

## Performance Results

Testing with large schemas shows significant improvements:

| Schema Size | Without Optimization | With Optimization |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 50 tables   | ~15,000 tokens       | ~3,500 tokens     |
| 100 tables  | ~30,000 tokens       | ~3,500 tokens     |
| 200+ tables | Token limit exceeded | ~3,500 tokens     |

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements include:

1. **Semantic Analysis**: Improve relevance scoring using more advanced NLP techniques
2. **Query History**: Consider previous queries for context
3. **Schema Metadata**: Leverage database documentation and comments
4. **Adaptive Sizing**: Dynamically adjust maxTables based on query complexity
5. **User Feedback**: Incorporate user feedback to improve table selection
